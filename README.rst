|Project Name| is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional
arrays.  It can use GPUs and perform efficient symbolic differentiation.

This is a fork of the `original Theano library <https://github.com/Theano/Theano>`__ that is being
maintained by the `PyMC team <https://github.com/pymc-devs>`__.

.. warning::
   The name of this repository/project may change in the near future.


Features
========

- A hackable, pure-Python codebase
- Extensible graph framework suitable for rapid development of custom symbolic optimizations
- Implements an extensible graph transpilation framework that currently provides
  compilation to C and JAX JITed Python functions
- Built on top of one of the most widely-used Python tensor libraries: Theano
