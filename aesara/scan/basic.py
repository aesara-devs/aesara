    r"""This function constructs and applies a `Scan` `Op` to the provided arguments.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fn
        `fn` is a function that describes the operations involved in one
        step of `scan`. `fn` should construct variables describing the
        output of one iteration step. It should expect as input
        `Variable`\s representing all the slices of the input sequences
        and previous values of the outputs, as well as all other arguments
        given to scan as `non_sequences`. The order in which scan passes
        these variables to `fn`  is the following :

        * all time slices of the first sequence
        * all time slices of the second sequence
        * ...
        * all time slices of the last sequence
        * all past slices of the first output
        * all past slices of the second output
        * ...
        * all past slices of the last output
        * all other arguments (the list given as `non_sequences` to
            `scan`)

        The order of the sequences is the same as the one in the list
        `sequences` given to `scan`. The order of the outputs is the same
        as the order of `outputs_info`. For any sequence or output the
        order of the time slices is the same as the one in which they have
        been given as taps. For example if one writes the following :

        .. code-block:: python

            scan(fn, sequences = [ dict(input= Sequence1, taps = [-3,2,-1])
                                 , Sequence2
                                 , dict(input =  Sequence3, taps = 3) ]
                   , outputs_info = [ dict(initial =  Output1, taps = [-3,-5])
                                    , dict(initial = Output2, taps = None)
                                    , Output3 ]
                   , non_sequences = [ Argument1, Argument2])

        `fn` should expect the following arguments in this given order:

        #. ``sequence1[t-3]``
        #. ``sequence1[t+2]``
        #. ``sequence1[t-1]``
        #. ``sequence2[t]``
        #. ``sequence3[t+3]``
        #. ``output1[t-3]``
        #. ``output1[t-5]``
        #. ``output3[t-1]``
        #. ``argument1``
        #. ``argument2``

        The list of `non_sequences` can also contain shared variables
        used in the function, though `scan` is able to figure those
        out on its own so they can be skipped. For the clarity of the
        code we recommend though to provide them to `scan`. To some extend
        `scan` can also figure out other `non sequences` (not shared)
        even if not passed to `scan` (but used by `fn`). A simple example of
        this would be :

        .. code-block:: python

            import aesara.tensor as aet

            W   = aet.matrix()
            W_2 = W**2

            def f(x):
                return aet.dot(x,W_2)

        The function `fn` is expected to return two things. One is a list of
        outputs ordered in the same order as `outputs_info`, with the
        difference that there should be only one output variable per
        output initial state (even if no tap value is used). Secondly
        `fn` should return an update dictionary (that tells how to
        update any shared variable after each iteration step). The
        dictionary can optionally be given as a list of tuples. There is
        no constraint on the order of these two list, `fn` can return
        either ``(outputs_list, update_dictionary)`` or
        ``(update_dictionary, outputs_list)`` or just one of the two (in
        case the other is empty).

        To use `scan` as a ``while`` loop, the user needs to change the
        function `fn` such that also a stopping condition is returned.
        To do so, one needs to wrap the condition in an `until` class.
        The condition should be returned as a third element, for example:

        .. code-block:: python

            ...
            return [y1_t, y2_t], {x:x+1}, until(x < 50)

        Note that a number of steps--considered in here as the maximum
        number of steps--is still required even though a condition is
        passed.  It is used to allocate memory if needed.

    sequences
        `sequences` is the list of `Variable`\s or ``dict``\s
        describing the sequences `scan` has to iterate over. If a
        sequence is given as wrapped in a ``dict``, then a set of optional
        information can be provided about the sequence. The ``dict``
        should have the following keys:

        * ``input`` (*mandatory*) -- `Variable` representing the
          sequence.

        * ``taps`` -- Temporal taps of the sequence required by `fn`.
          They are provided as a list of integers, where a value ``k``
          impiles that at iteration step ``t`` scan will pass to `fn`
          the slice ``t+k``. Default value is ``[0]``

        All `Variable`\s in the list `sequences` are automatically
        wrapped into a ``dict`` where ``taps`` is set to ``[0]``

    outputs_info
        `outputs_info` is the list of `Variable`\s or ``dict``\s
        describing the initial state of the outputs computed
        recurrently. When the initial states are given as ``dict``\s,
        optional information can be provided about the output corresponding
        to those initial states. The ``dict`` should have the following
        keys:

        * ``initial`` -- A `Variable` that represents the initial
          state of a given output. In case the output is not computed
          recursively (e.g. a ``map``-like function) and does not require an initial
          state, this field can be skipped. Given that only the previous
          time step of the output is used by `fn`, the initial state
          **should have the same shape** as the output and **should not
          involve a downcast** of the data type of the output. If multiple
          time taps are used, the initial state should have one extra
          dimension that covers all the possible taps. For example
          if we use ``-5``, ``-2`` and ``-1`` as past taps, at step ``0``,
          `fn` will require (by an abuse of notation) ``output[-5]``,
          ``output[-2]`` and ``output[-1]``. This will be given by
          the initial state, which in this case should have the shape
          ``(5,) + output.shape``. If this `Variable` containing the initial
          state is called ``init_y`` then ``init_y[0]`` corresponds to
          ``output[-5]``. ``init_y[1]`` corresponds to ``output[-4]``,
          ``init_y[2]`` corresponds to ``output[-3]``, ``init_y[3]``
          corresponds to ``output[-2]``, ``init_y[4]`` corresponds to
          ``output[-1]``.
          While this order might seem strange, it comes natural from splitting
          an array at a given point. assume that we have a array ``x``, and we
          choose ``k`` to be time step ``0``. Then our initial state would be
          ``x[:k]``, while the output will be ``x[k:]``. Looking at this split,
          elements in ``x[:k]`` are ordered exactly like those in ``init_y``.
        * ``taps`` -- Temporal taps of the output that will be passed to
          `fn`. They are provided as a list of *negative* integers,
          where a value ``k`` implies that at iteration step ``t`` scan
          will pass to `fn` the slice ``t+k``.

        `scan` will follow this logic if partial information is given:

        * If an output is not wrapped in a ``dict``, `scan` will wrap
          it in one assuming that you use only the last step of the output
          (i.e. it makes your tap value list equal to ``[-1]``).
        * If you wrap an output in a ``dict`` and you do not provide any
          taps but you provide an initial state it will assume that you are
          using only a tap value of ``-1``.
        * If you wrap an output in a ``dict`` but you do not provide any
          initial state, it assumes that you are not using any form of
          taps.
        * If you provide a ``None`` instead of a `Variable` or a empty
          ``dict`` `scan` assumes that you will not use any taps for
          this output (like for example in case of a ``map``)

        If `outputs_info` is an empty ``list`` or ``None``, `scan` assumes
        that no tap is used for any of the outputs. If information is
        provided just for a subset of the outputs, an exception is
        raised, because there is no convention on how scan should map
        the provided information to the outputs of `fn`.

    non_sequences
        `non_sequences` is the list of arguments that are passed to
        `fn` at each steps. One can choose to exclude variables
        used in `fn` from this list, as long as they are part of the
        computational graph, although--for clarity--this is *not* encouraged.

    n_steps
        `n_steps` is the number of steps to iterate given as an ``int``
        or a scalar `Variable`. If any of the input sequences do not have
        enough elements, `scan` will raise an error. If the value is ``0``, the
        outputs will have ``0`` rows. If `n_steps` is not provided, `scan` will
        figure out the amount of steps it should run given its input
        sequences. ``n_steps < 0`` is not supported anymore.

    truncate_gradient
        `truncate_gradient` is the number of steps to use in truncated
        back-propagation through time (BPTT).  If you compute gradients through
        a `Scan` `Op`, they are computed using BPTT. By providing a different
        value then ``-1``, you choose to use truncated BPTT instead of classical
        BPTT, where you go for only `truncate_gradient` number of steps back in
        time.

    go_backwards
        `go_backwards` is a flag indicating if `scan` should go
        backwards through the sequences. If you think of each sequence
        as indexed by time, making this flag ``True`` would mean that
        `scan` goes back in time, namely that for any sequence it
        starts from the end and goes towards ``0``.

    name
        When profiling `scan`, it is helpful to provide a name for any
        instance of `scan`.
        For example, the profiler will produce an overall profile of your code
        as well as profiles for the computation of one step of each instance of
        `Scan`. The `name` of the instance appears in those profiles and can
        greatly help to disambiguate information.

    mode
        The mode used to compile the inner-graph.
        If you prefer the computations of one step of `scan` to be done
        differently then the entire function, you can use this parameter to
        describe how the computations in this loop are done (see
        `aesara.function` for details about possible values and their meaning).

    profile
        If ``True`` or a non-empty string, a profile object will be created and
        attached to the inner graph of `Scan`. When `profile` is ``True``, the
        profiler results will use the name of the `Scan` instance, otherwise it
        will use the passed string.  The profiler only collects and prints
        information when running the inner graph with the `CVM` `Linker`.

    allow_gc
        Set the value of `allow_gc` for the internal graph of the `Scan`.  If
        set to ``None``, this will use the value of
        `aesara.config.scan__allow_gc`.

        The full `Scan` behavior related to allocation is determined by this
        value and the flag `aesara.config.allow_gc`. If the flag
        `allow_gc` is ``True`` (default) and this `allow_gc` is ``False``
        (default), then we let `Scan` allocate all intermediate memory
        on the first iteration, and they are not garbage collected
        after that first iteration; this is determined by `allow_gc`. This can
        speed up allocation of the subsequent iterations. All those temporary
        allocations are freed at the end of all iterations; this is what the
        flag `aesara.config.allow_gc` means.

        If you use pre-allocation and this `Scan` is on GPU, the speed up from
        `allow_gc` is small. If you are missing memory, disabling `allow_gc`
        could help you run graph that request much memory.

    strict
        If ``True``, all the shared variables used in `fn` must be provided as a
        part of `non_sequences` or `sequences`.

    return_list
        If ``True``, will always return a ``list``, even if there is only one output.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        ``tuple`` of the form ``(outputs, updates)``.
        ``outputs`` is either a `Variable` or a ``list`` of `Variable`\s
        representing the outputs in the same order as in `outputs_info`.
        ``updates`` is a subclass of ``dict`` specifying the update rules for
        all shared variables used in `Scan`.
        This ``dict`` should be passed to `aesara.function` when you compile
        your function.
