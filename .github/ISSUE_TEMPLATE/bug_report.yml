      First, carefully read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the following to determine whether or not you have a valid Aesara issue:

      - Is there already a GitHub Issue or Discussion for this issue?

      If so, please expand upon any specifics of your issue in the existing Issue/Discussion.

      - Does your issue only arise in a library that uses Aesara?

      If so, please submit your issue to that library's issue tracker first.  From there, the Aesara-specific details can be worked out and a valid Aesara issue can be identified.  **Issues framed primarily in third-party libraries are liable to being marked as invalid and closed.**

      - Does your issue involve OS and/or environment-specific settings (e.g. installation and/or compilation issues)?

      If so, please create a [Discussion](https://github.com/aesara-devs/aesara/discussions) instead.  From there, we can help determine whether or not the issue is due to faulty logic in Aesara (i.e. a valid issue) or something specific to your local setup.

      I'm trying to compute the ... of ... as follows:

      ```python
      import aesara
      import aesara.tensor as at

      x = at.vector("x")
      ...

      fn = aesara.function([x], ...)

      fn(...)
      ```

      The results should be the value...
